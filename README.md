# cube_renderer3d
Simple cube renderer 3D written in MIPS assembly language with output to bitmap file.

Project 5. Renderer. 
Generate cube mesh and manipulate its position (translation and rotation). 
There should be renderer implemented with projection and operation on matrices.

MIPS:

Input:
- parameters defining potition from observer (x, y, z) and rotation around (x, y, z) axis

Output:
- bmp file with rendered cube mesh
